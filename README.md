I'm inclined more towards the Computer security field. I write mostly about cyber security, data privacy. I consult on risk management, organization policy.
I think data has become more valuable than oil in the last century and securing and guarding data will ultimately be the utmost requirement for any organization 
that is serious about securing their digital and physical assets.

I usually engage in such discussions on my social media profiles. Feel free to stalk me and engage me. I always respond.

**STAY FAFE!**
